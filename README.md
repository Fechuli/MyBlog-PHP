# MyBlog-PHP

This project is a synthesis of my learning the PHP language. A blog that allows you to make, post and delete posts in a database linked to the web page.
The following credentials are needed to access the 'administrator section:

###USER

federico

###PASSWORD

federicopass

This will give you access to the 'administrator's panel.
